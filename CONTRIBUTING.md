# Contributing to RangoGM's Networking Labs

Thank you for your interest in my networking research! Since this is a personal repository dedicated to my CCNA journey and Network Security studies, I have a specific process for contributions.

## How to Contribute
1. **Feedback:** If you find an error in a topology or a configuration, please open an **Issue**.
2. **Suggestions:** Have a better way to secure a VLAN or an IPv6 neighbor discovery process? I'd love to hear it!
3. **Discussions:** Feel free to reach out via the contact methods in my profile.

## Pull Request Process
- Ensure your suggested changes are tested in **CML** or **GNS3/EVE-NG**.
- Provide a brief description of why the change is beneficial.
- I will review all suggestions to ensure they align with CCNA/Network Security best practices.

Let's learn and build more secure networks together!
