# ccna-labs
This repository contains my CCNA pratice labs implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The purpose of this repository is not only to practice configuration, but also to deeply understanding networking concepts, traffic flow, and troubleshooting techniques at CCNA level.

Although Packet Tracer is a simulation tool, all labs focus on:
- Understanding real networking concepts.
- Correct configuration logic.
- Verification and troubleshooting.

## Repository Structure

Each folder represents one independent lab and contains:
- Packet Tracer file (.pkt)
- Lab-specify README with:
  - Topology description
  - Goal
  - Example Configuration (CLI)
  - Key configurations
  - Verification steps
  - Common troubleshooting notes (if any)

## Labs Included
- **Lab 01**: Basic VLAN Configuration (Access Ports)
- **Lab 02A**: VLAN Trunking (Default Trunk)
- **Lab 02B**: VLAN Trunking (Allowed VLAN Restriction)
- **Lab 02C** **(EXTRA)**: VLAN Trunking (Native VLAN mismatch)
- **Lab 03**: Inter-VLAN Routing (Router-on-a-Stick)
- **Lab 04**: DHCP
- **LAB 05(A)**: STP
- **LAB 05B**: STP Root Bridge
- **LAB 05C**: STP PortFast & BPDU Guard
- **LAB 06**: Ethernet Channel
- **LAB 07**: Static Routing
- **LAB 08**: Dynamic Routing (RIPv2)

## Goal 

This ropository documents my CCNA learning journey and prepares me for real-world network configuration and troubleshooting scenarios.
