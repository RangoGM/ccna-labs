# 🛡️ Security Policy

## Overview
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my networking research, CCNA preparation, and technical labs. My work encompasses a wide range of technologies across the OSI model, including **Layer 2 (Data Link)**, **Layer 3 (Network)**, **Layer 4 (Transport)**, and beyond. Every configuration and script here is a product of my dedicated study and passion for building secure and efficient networks.

## Supported Environments
These labs are primarily designed and tested within the following environments:
- **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)** & **Packet Tracer**
- **Cisco IOS/IOSv** (Various versions)
- **Virtualization:** VMware Workstation Pro
- **Security Testing:** Kali Linux

## Reporting Vulnerabilities or Feedback
Since this is an evolving research project, I am committed to continuous improvement. If you discover any security flaws in my lab scenarios, configuration errors, or have suggestions to enhance the architecture (at any layer), please reach out to me:

- **Email:** [Your Gmail Address Here]
- **Connect with me:** Through the links provided in my main README profile.

I value constructive feedback from the community to help me grow as a future Network Engineer and to ensure these resources remain high-quality.
